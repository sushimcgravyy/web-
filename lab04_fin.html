            <h2>Why BSc Creative Media?</h2>
            <p>Our programme delivers interdisciplinary teaching by crossing the boundaries among digital media, design,
                and computer science, which bridges creative and technical sides of computer-based media art production.
                Students will be trained in computer graphics, digital imaging, mobile media, user-interface (UI) and
                user-experience (UX)
                design, computer games and interactive media.</p>

                to produce graduates who are able to bridge the gap between the technical and artistic sides of the
                media
                field. Graduates will be capable of using the latest computing and media technologies in the creation of
                various media including computer games, UI/UX, animation, special effects, sound, wireless and mobile
                media, internet
                application, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, and interactive installation.</p>
